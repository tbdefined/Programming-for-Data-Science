# Udacity - Programming for Data Science with Python

This is a repository for all of the projects related to the nano degree for "Programming for Data Science with Python". It was a very inspiring project!


## Project 1 - DVD Data Base

* In order to get a better overview about the possibilities of SQL-databases, udacity participants where asked to extract several information from an online DVD rental data base. 

## Project 2 - US Bike Rental Data

* To push technical skills further, the program required all participants getting familiar with basic and advanced Python commands. This, not only in order to grind on the most common actions related to data science, but also to get everyone on a level that justifies the description of "well-rounded coding starters".

## Project 3 - Uploading everything to GitHub

* As a last step students where asked to upload their work to GitHub. Furthermore, we were asked to fill out a form that includes all necessary git commands to do so.
